## 🚀 Run it locally

You'll need [Node.js 18.18+](https://nodejs.org) installed.

```bash
cd mayorshirley
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open **http://localhost:3000** in your browser.

---

## ▲ Deploy to Vercel

**Option A — fastest (drag & drop a Git repo):**

1. Create a free account at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com).
2. Push this `mayorshirley` folder to a new GitHub repository.
3. In Vercel, click **Add New → Project**, import that repo.
4. Vercel auto-detects Next.js — just click **Deploy**. No settings needed.
5. After it builds, add your domain under **Project → Settings → Domains**:
   enter `www.mayorshirley.com` and follow the DNS instructions Vercel shows.

**Option B — from the command line:**

```bash
npm install -g vercel
cd mayorshirley
vercel          # follow prompts; accept the defaults
vercel --prod   # deploy to production
```

Every time you push to your GitHub `main` branch, Vercel redeploys automatically.

---

## 📨 Contact form setup (Formspree)

The contact form is wired for [Formspree](https://formspree.io) — free, no
backend required, and it delivers messages to **rshirley@hollyspringsga.us**.

1. Sign up at [formspree.io](https://formspree.io) using `rshirley@hollyspringsga.us`.
2. Create a new form. Formspree gives you an endpoint like
   `https://formspree.io/f/abcdwxyz`.
3. Open **`lib/content.ts`** and replace the placeholder:

   ```ts
   formspreeEndpoint: "https://formspree.io/f/your-form-id",
   //  ↑ paste your real endpoint here
   ```

4. Save and redeploy. Submissions now arrive in your inbox and the Formspree
   dashboard.

> Until you add a real endpoint, the form safely falls back to opening the
> visitor's email app addressed to the Mayor's office — so it works either way.

## ✏️ Updating content (no coding needed)

**Almost all the text on the site lives in one file: `lib/content.ts`.**
Open it, edit the wording inside the quotes, save, and redeploy.

**Add a new city update** — find the `updates` array and copy an existing block:

```ts
{
  slug: "short-url-name",          // letters/dashes only, must be unique
  title: "Your update title",
  date: "July 1, 2026",
  category: "City",                // City | Roads | Parks | Public Safety | Community | Development
  summary: "One or two sentence preview.",
  body: [
    "First paragraph.",
    "Second paragraph.",
  ],
},
```

**Add a press release** → same idea in the `pressReleases` array.
**Add/edit a project** → the `projects` array (`status` must be
`"In Progress"`, `"Planned"`, or `"Completed"`).
**Add an event** → the `events` array.

Keep the quotes, commas, and brackets in place. After saving, commit/push (or
re-run `vercel --prod`) and the site updates.

## 🖼️ Adding the Mayor's photo

The Hero and About pages are already wired to display `public/mayor.jpg`.
**Just add the file:**

1. Save the mayor's portrait as **`mayor.jpg`** inside the `public/` folder
   (i.e. `mayorshirley/public/mayor.jpg`). A portrait/vertical photo works best.
2. Commit and push (or run `vercel --prod`). The photo appears automatically.

### City logo

The navbar and footer display the official Holly Springs city logo from
**`public/holly_springs_logo.png`**. A transparent or white-background PNG works
best. (If you rename the file, update the two `src="/holly_springs_logo.png"`
references in `components/Navbar.tsx` and `components/Footer.tsx` to match.)

### Hero background photo

The homepage hero can show a background photo behind the headline. Drop a wide
image at **`public/hero-bg.jpg`** and it appears automatically (with a navy
overlay so the text stays readable). If no file is present, the hero falls back
to its navy gradient — no error. A Town Center, downtown, or civic photo works
great here.

### Photos on Updates & Projects

Each update and project can show its own photo. If you don't add one, the card
displays a tasteful color banner instead — so the pages always look polished.

To add a photo:

1. Save the image in `public/` (a subfolder keeps things tidy, e.g.
   `public/updates/amphitheater.jpg`).
2. In `lib/content.ts`, add an `image` line to that update or project:

   ```ts
   {
     slug: "town-center-amphitheater",
     title: "New Town Center Amphitheater Taking Shape",
     // ...existing fields...
     image: "/updates/amphitheater.jpg",   // ← add this line
   },
   ```

3. Commit, push, and the photo replaces the color banner.

> Only use photos you have the rights to — your own/city photos, or images
> you're permitted to use. Save Facebook photos from your own posts and add them
> the same way.

To use other images elsewhere, drop them in `public/` and reference them with a
leading slash, e.g. `<Image src="/holly-springs.jpg" ... />`.

## 🎨 Branding

The red-white-blue civic palette is defined in `tailwind.config.ts` under
`colors.flag` and `colors.navy`. Change those hex values to re-theme the entire
site at once.
